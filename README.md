# 🤖 LLM Learning Journey: From Fundamentals to Production

A project-based learning path through Large Language Models, covering everything from data pipelines to production systems.

## 🎯 Goal

Master LLM fundamentals through hands-on projects to:
1. **Teach these concepts** to others
2. **Build production-ready projects** for portfolio

---

## 📚 Learning Path

### ✅ Week 1: Data Pipeline - Collection, Extraction & Cleaning

**Topics:** Web scraping, HTML extraction, deduplication, quality filtering

Learn how production LLMs prepare training data by building a complete data cleaning pipeline from scratch.

**What you'll learn:**
- Data collection strategies (web crawls, APIs, curated datasets)
- Extraction techniques (Trafilatura, rule-based parsing)
- Cleaning pipeline (normalization, language detection, quality filtering)
- How Dolma, FineWeb, and RefinedWeb approach data cleaning

**📓 [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/happyahluwalia/llm_journey/blob/main/week-01-data-pipeline/Data_Cleaning_Pipeline.ipynb)** ← Click to run in browser!


### ✅ Tokenization Fundamentals 
**Status:** Complete | **Topics:** BPE algorithm, token counting, cost optimization, context management

Learn how LLMs convert text to tokens and why it matters for building applications.

**Key Concepts:**
- Why subword tokenization (BPE) is necessary
- How the BPE algorithm works
- Practical token management (counting, costs, limits)
- Real-world implications (multilingual, model limitations)
