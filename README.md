# 🤖 LLM Learning Journey: From Fundamentals to Production

A project-based learning path through Large Language Models, covering everything from data pipelines to production systems.

## 🎯 Goal

Master LLM fundamentals through hands-on projects to:
1. **Teach these concepts** to others
2. **Build production-ready projects** for portfolio

---

## 📚 Learning Path

### ✅ Week 1: Data Pipeline - Collection, Extraction & Cleaning

**Topics:** Web scraping, HTML extraction, deduplication, quality filtering

Learn how production LLMs prepare training data by building a complete data cleaning pipeline from scratch.

**What you'll learn:**
- Data collection strategies (web crawls, APIs, curated datasets)
- Extraction techniques (Trafilatura, rule-based parsing)
- Cleaning pipeline (normalization, language detection, quality filtering)
- How Dolma, FineWeb, and RefinedWeb approach data cleaning
